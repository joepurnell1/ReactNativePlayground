# Artists Search App - Playground
This project is intented to be a simple messaround app to try new libraries, syntax, and anything else.

Plain and simple React Native, bit of state usage, and using the fetch api for data. Feel free to use this as a springboard for any experimentation you want to do.

## Data
This uses the Spotify API for getting artist data, you will need a bearer token and add it as the value in `ArtistsService.js`. You can get the token from here [Spotify Docs](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-search-item/?q=tania%20bowra&type=artist&market=&limit=&offset=) here you can click 'Get Token' and use the returned token. I'll probably find a sexier way to do this.

## Prerequisits
Just make sure you run `npm i` and you should be good to go just run `npm start` then your platform command!

## Included Commands
Out the box:

```npm start```

```npm run ios```

```npm run android```

```npm test```

## That's all
I simply intend to use this as a basline for messing with new things. Feel free to do the same :)
